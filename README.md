## Features

C108-Lab packages are:

- **Curated** – Centrally developed and maintained for consistency
- **Production-ready** – Thoroughly tested and documented
- **Dependency-conscious** – Core package stays lightweight; extra features and heavy deps live in sub-packages
- **Community-friendly** – Issues and feature requests are welcome

`c108` has **no external dependencies**, standard library only.

## Development Reference

### Commands 🖥️

#### **1. Create dev environment locally**

```bash
uv venv                            # creates .venv
uv sync --extra dev                # sync with dev environment with optional ML and Scientific deps
uv sync --extra test --extra tools # sync with basic dev environment, no ML or Scientific deps
```

#### **2. Format** with `ruff`

```shell
ruff format c108 tests
```

#### **3. Run Tests** with `uv run COMMAND`

Unit tests only (the subset used in CI):

```bash
pytest
```

Integration tests only (run locally):

```bash
pytest -m "integration"
```

Specific integration module:

```shell
pytest tests/integration/test_numeric.py
```

Unit and Integration tests:

```bash
pytest -m "integration or not integration"
```

Doctests:

```bash
pytest --xdoctest c108
```

#### **4. Build and publish**

```bash
# Build wheel + sdist via Hatchling
uv build
# Publish to PyPI; secrets handled by CI
uv publish --token ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

### Test Structure ✅

- **Unit tests** (fast, minimal deps): live in `tests/` and are always run by CI.
- **Integration tests** (optional, heavy deps): live in `tests/integration/` and cover interactions with external
  packages such as NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Astropy, and SymPy.

All integration tests use `pytest.importorskip()`,
automatically **skipped** if a dependency is missing.

### Test Dependencies

Integration tests use optional third‑party packages that are **not** required
by the core test suite:

| Package    | Supported Types            |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Astropy    | Physical `Quantity` types  |
| JAX        | DeviceArray scalars        |
| NumPy      | Numeric scalars and arrays |
| Pandas     | Nullable scalars/Series    |
| PyTorch    | Tensor dtypes              |
| SymPy      | Symbolic numeric support   |
| TensorFlow | Tensor dtypes              |

Install only what you need, for example:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas
```

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs only unit tests for performance and reliability.

Integration tests are intended for local verification before releasing major versions
or dependency interface changes.
